## Palettes and Toolbars

Mathematica provides a series of toolbars and palettes. 

Toolbars are found under Window â–¸ Toolbar

Palettes are found under the Palettes menu

Most useful of the toolbars for every day use is the Formatting toolbar.

All of the palettes are useful, but perhaps the Writing Assistant more so than the others.
