## Function Aliases

Mathematica has a series of useful function aliases that make coding more concise and readable.

Technically, these are called  *infix operators* , a term that also encapsulates  ```+``` ,  ```-``` , and  ```*``` , but that’s unimportant for their usage here.

### @ (Prefix)

The  ```@```  alias is like a pair of square brackets. The following illustrates its usage:

	N@π

	(*Out:*)
	
	3.141592653589793`

It only applies to a single argument however. For example, Mathematica will not evaluate the following command

	N@π,12

### /@ (Map)

```/@```  takes a function and applies to every element in a list, returning the list of results. Example:

	Sin/@(π*{0,1/4,1/2,3/4,1,1+1/4,1+1/2,1+3/4,2})

	(*Out:*)
	
	{0,,1,,0,-,-1,-,0}

When using this alias care should be taken that the right-hand side is wrapped in parentheses, as was done above, if it’s more than just a simple list.

### @@ (Apply)

```@@```  applies a function to all the arguments in a list. That is, the elements of the list become the arguments to the function. Example:

	N@@{π,12}

	(*Out:*)
	
	3.14159265358979323846264338327950419984`12.

### // (Postfix)

```//```  is more or less a reversed form of  ```@``` . Example:

	π//N

	(*Out:*)
	
	3.141592653589793`

But there is a small difference in terms of how the two work with other operators.

Consider you’re trying to apply the function  ```f```  to the list of results generated by using  ```g/@{1,2,3,4}``` 
One might first try the following:

	f@g/@{1,2,3,4}

	(*Out:*)
	
	{f[g][1],f[g][2],f[g][3],f[g][4]}

This clearly doesn’t work.  ```f```  is applied to  ```g```  before being mapped across  ```{1,2,3,4}``` .

In this case there are two options:

	f@(g/@{1,2,3,4})

	(*Out:*)
	
	f[{g[1],g[2],g[3],g[4]}]

or

	g/@{1,2,3,4}//f

	(*Out:*)
	
	f[{g[1],g[2],g[3],g[4]}]

because  ```/@```  evaluates before  ```//``` , this works. What is said is that  ```//```  has a  *low precedence* .

Precedences for any operator can be checked using the function  ```Precedence``` , if the function name is known. Function names for a given operator can be found by selecting the operator and using ––F on Mac or F1 on Windows.

For example, knowing that  ```//```  is an alias for the function  ```Postfix```

	Precedence@Postfix

	(*Out:*)
	
	70.`

And we’ll compare that to the function  ```Prefix```  for which  ```@```  is an alias

	Prefix//Precedence

	(*Out:*)
	
	640.`

### ~ (Infix)

```~```  takes a function and applies it to the preceding and following arguments as follows:

	π~N~12

	(*Out:*)
	
	3.14159265358979323846264338327950419984`12.

This is useful and worth knowing, but it can often be cleaner simply to use  ```@@``` , potentially in combination with  ```//```

### ```@*```  (Composition)

```@*```  takes a two functions and composes them. For example:

	(f@*g)[1]

	(*Out:*)
	
	f[g[1]]

This is particularly useful when negating a function, that is, applying the  ```Not```  function to it. We can make a simple  ```NotTrueQ```  function by doing this:

	NotTrueQ = (Not@*TrueQ);
	NotTrueQ@1
	NotTrueQ@False
	NotTrueQ@True

	(*Out:*)
	
	True

	(*Out:*)
	
	True

	(*Out:*)
	
	False
