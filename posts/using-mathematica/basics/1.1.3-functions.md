## Functions

Functions are common to all programming languages. They work exactly like the name suggests. A single input or set of inputs is mapped to a single output.

In Mathematica, functions are defined using variables followed by an underscore square brackets and can be defined with either  ```=```  or  ```:=``` , which has the same meaning as with variables.

```=```  uses the immediate values of the right hand side while  ```:=```  recalculates these when called for.

The  ```:=```  definition works most similarly to standard programming languages and is the definition I would suggest using by default

Here we'll define a simple function to add two primes using  ```:=```

	primeSum[n1_, n2_] := Prime[n1] + Prime[n2]

	primeSum[1, 10]

	(*Out:*)
	
	31

The same works with plain  ```=```

	primeSum[n1_, n2_] = Prime[n1] + Prime[n2]

	(*Out:*)
	
	Prime[n1] + Prime[n2]

	primeSum[1, 10]

	(*Out:*)
	
	31

### Differences between  =  and  :=

Let’s write a more complex function that moves a position around randomly. This position could be the position of an atom, say as hydrogen. Let’s start it out at the origin.

	hydrogenPosition = {0, 0, 0};

Now we’ll define a function to move our hydrogen around randomly and return where it is now.

	moveOurH[] :=
	  Row@{
	     "H is at:",
	     hydrogenPosition +=
	       {
	         RandomReal[{-1, 1}],
	         RandomReal[{-1, 1}],
	         RandomReal[{-1, 1}]
	         }
	     }

	moveOurH[]

	(*Out:*)
	
	Row[{"H is at:", {0.524521, 0.626446, -0.705801}}]

	moveOurH[]

	(*Out:*)
	
	Row[{"H is at:", {0.239477, 0.598285, -1.29094}}]

	moveOurH[]

	(*Out:*)
	
	Row[{"H is at:", {-0.632497, 0.50078, -0.826784}}]

Now let’s try to do the same, but using  ```=```

	hydrogenPosition = {0, 0, 0};

	moveOurH[] =
	   Row@{
	      "H is at:",
	      hydrogenPosition +=
	        {
	          RandomReal[{-1, 1}],
	          RandomReal[{-1, 1}],
	          RandomReal[{-1, 1}]
	          }
	      };

	moveOurH[]

	(*Out:*)
	
	Row[{"H is at:", {-0.279658, -0.455241, -0.0753173}}]

	moveOurH[]

	(*Out:*)
	
	Row[{"H is at:", {-0.279658, -0.455241, -0.0753173}}]

	moveOurH[]

	(*Out:*)
	
	Row[{"H is at:", {-0.279658, -0.455241, -0.0753173}}]

You’ll notice our position doesn’t change. That’s because the right hand side was evaluated as the function was defined.

Note that this is not always a bug. Sometimes this can be a feature as there are instances where having most values set is useful.

### Function

There is also a special type called  Function  which is defined as follows:

	Function[{var1, var2, var3, ..., varn}, code]

This is useful primarily in complicated code when a simple function needs to be used just once or twice and it is not worth defining a full function to do this.

This form of function can also be defined as follows:

	(code &)

where  var1,var2,var3,...,varn  are replaced by  #1,#2,...,#n  in the code. For example:

	Function[
	  {a, b, c},
	  Grid@{
	     {"a is:", a},
	     {"b is:", b},
	     {"c is:", c}
	     }
	  ]

could be written as:

	(Grid@{
	     {"a is:", #1},
	     {"b is:", #2},
	     {"c is:", #3}
	     } &)

And to see that they are in fact the same function:

	Function[
	   {a, b, c},
	   Grid@{
	      {"a is:", a},
	      {"b is:", b},
	      {"c is:", c}
	      }
	   ][1, 2, 3]

	(*Out:*)
	
<table class="grid"><tbody><tr><td><p>"a is:"</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"b is:"</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"c is:"</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

	(Grid@{
	      {"a is:", #1},
	      {"b is:", #2},
	      {"c is:", #3}
	      } &)[1, 2, 3]

	(*Out:*)
	
<table class="grid"><tbody><tr><td><p>"a is:"</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"b is:"</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"c is:"</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

In Mathematica these are known as pure functions, to distinguish them from functions defined the way we’ve done before.
