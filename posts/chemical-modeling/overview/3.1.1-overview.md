## Intro

The following is a way to work atoms and molecules in Mathematica. We’ll use a combination of all the methods described in the section  ```Useful Tricks ▸ Object Oriented Programming``` .

This degree of complexity is unnecessary, but informative.

We’ll use a symbol interface type for our systems, and a mixture of managed types and association interfaces for the rest of our objects.
