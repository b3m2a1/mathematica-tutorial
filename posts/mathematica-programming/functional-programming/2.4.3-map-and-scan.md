## Map / Scan

Note that often we can even one-up  ```Table```  and  ```Do```  in terms of simplicity, while losing no performance.  ```Map```  and  ```Scan```  pass an argument from a list to a function, much as  ```Table```  and  ```Do```  iterate over a range or list:

	Table[PrimeQ@i,{i,10^6}]//
	AbsoluteTiming//First

	(*Out:*)
	
	0.369371`

compared to

	Map[PrimeQ,Range[10^6]]//
	AbsoluteTiming//First

	(*Out:*)
	
	0.3625`

Even better, though,  ```Map```  has a more compact in-line syntax:

	PrimeQ/@Range[10^6]//
	AbsoluteTiming//First

	(*Out:*)
	
	0.374421`

Over time you will start thinking in this new syntax. Rather than “map prime-q over range of 10^6” you will start to think “prime-q slash at range of 10^6”.

Note that both  ```Map```  and  ```Table```  generate output, while their equivalents  ```Scan```  and  ```Do```  don’t. Even though  ```Scan```  does not have in-line syntax it is worth getting to know, as it can sometimes be more efficient than  ```Do```  and is, of course, vastly more efficient than  ```For```
