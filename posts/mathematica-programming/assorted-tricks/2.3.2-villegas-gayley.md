## Villegas-Gayley (internal function overloads)

This is a way we can assign definitions to built-in functions cleanly. This takes advantage of a two main things, a conditional definition and the power of  ```Block``` . We’ll use it to overload how  ```MessageName```  works.

	Unprotect@MessageName;
	(MessageName[o_,a:Except["usage"]]/;!TrueQ@$recursionBreakingVariable):=
	If[
	MatchQ[o,object[_Association]],
	First[o][a],
	Block[{$recursionBreakingVariable=True},
	MessageName[o,a]
	]
	];
	Protect@MessageName;

Now we can do fun things with the  ```MessageName```  operator,  ```::```

	object[<|"a"b,"c"d,"e"f|>]::a

	(*Out:*)
	
	b

Usually that would have thrown an error:

	abject[<|"a"b,"c"d,"e"f|>]::a


<div class='mma-message'>
	<span class='mma-message-name'>Message::name:</span>
	<span class='mma-message-text'>Message name MessageName[abject[Association["a"->b,"c"->d,"e"->f]],"a"] is not of the form symbol::name or symbol::name::language.</span>
</div>

	(*Out:*)
	
	MessageName[abject[Association["a"b,"c"d,"e"f]],"a"]

And the reason we did this the way we did is because if we assigned some object to a variable,  ```variable::a```  would give us something meaningless. See:

	variable=abject[<|"a"b,"c"d,"e"f|>];

	variable::a

	(*Out:*)
	
	variable::a

But if it’s an object it will be treated differently:

	variable=object[<|"a"b,"c"d,"e"f|>];

	variable::a

	(*Out:*)
	
	b

And because of the structure of the overload,  ```MessageName```  still works normally in every other case.
