## Import and ReadList

```Import```  has a peculiar feature. It requires vastly more memory than the size of the file being imported, which can lead to nasty behavior, sometimes. To get around this one would think of importing line-by-line as one does in python or C++ and the  ```ReadLine```  function seems perfect for the job.

Unfortunately  ```ReadLine```  is horrendously slow. So the better thing to do is to use  ```ReadList``` , line, by line on an  ```InputStream```  object.

For example, let’s make an input stream from the following URL:

	textFile=URLDownload[
	"https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/iso_8859-1.txt",
	FileNameJoin@{$TemporaryDirectory,"read_list_example.txt"}
	];
	textStream=OpenRead@textFile

	(*Out:*)
	
![23-2584241647775519822]({filename}/img/23-2584241647775519822.png)

Now let’s read some lines using  ```ReadLine```  and do the same with  ```ReadList```  and compare the performance:

You’ll notice the performance is drastically different. Even getting the proper text has no discernible effect.

Now this file is a text file that contains hex integer-description pairs, so let’s pull these out as rules. We’ll do this using patterns,  ```Reap```  and  ```Sow``` . Note that the relevant data looks like “<key>  description” so we’ll use  ```StringReplace```  on that pattern.

	Replace[Reap@Do[With[{f=ReadList[textStream,String,1]},If[MatchQ[f,{}],Replace[ReadLine@textStream,{EndOfFile:>Return[],s_StringStringReplace[s,key__~~"  "~~desc__~~("  "|EndOfString)Sow@{key,desc}]}],StringReplace[First@f,key:(Except[" "]..)~~"  "~~desc:Shortest[__]~~("  "|EndOfString)Sow@{key,desc}]]],∞],{_,{data_}}data]

	{ {"65","SMALL LETTER E"},{"E5","SMALL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE"},{"66","SMALL LETTER F"},{"E6","SMALL LETTER AE"},{"67","SMALL LETTER G"},{"E7","SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA"},{"68","SMALL LETTER H"},{"E8","SMALL LETTER E WITH GRAVE"},{"69","SMALL LETTER I"},{"E9","SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE"},{"6A","SMALL LETTER J"},{"EA","SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX"},{"6B","SMALL LETTER K"},{"EB","SMALL LETTER E WITH DIAERESIS"},{"6C","SMALL LETTER L"},{"EC","SMALL LETTER I WITH GRAVE"},{"6D","SMALL LETTER M"},{"ED","SMALL LETTER I WITH ACUTE"},{"6E","SMALL LETTER N"},{"EE","SMALL LETTER I WITH CIRCUMFLEX"},{"6F","SMALL LETTER O"},{"EF","SMALL LETTER I WITH DIAERESIS"},{"70","SMALL LETTER P"},{"F0","SMALL LETTER ETH (Icelandic)"},{"71","SMALL LETTER Q"},{"F1","SMALL LETTER N WITH TILDE"},{"72","SMALL LETTER R"},{"F2","SMALL LETTER O WITH GRAVE"},{"73","SMALL LETTER S"},{"F3","SMALL LETTER O WITH ACUTE"},{"74","SMALL LETTER T"},{"F4","SMALL LETTER O WITH CIRCUMFLEX"},{"75","SMALL LETTER U"},{"F5","SMALL LETTER O WITH TILDE"},{"76","SMALL LETTER V"},{"F6","SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS"},{"77","SMALL LETTER W"},{"F7","DIVISION SIGN"},{"78","SMALL LETTER X"},{"F8","SMALL LETTER O WITH STROKE"},{"79","SMALL LETTER Y"},{"F9","SMALL LETTER U WITH GRAVE"},{"7A","SMALL LETTER Z"},{"FA","SMALL LETTER U WITH ACUTE"},{"7B","LEFT CURLY BRACKET"},{"FB","SMALL LETTER U WITH CIRCUMFLEX"},{"7C","VERTICAL LINE"},{"FC","SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS"},{"7D","RIGHT CURLY BRACKET"},{"FD","SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE"},{"7E","TILDE"},{"FE","SMALL LETTER THORN (Icelandic)"},{"FF","SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS"}}

There’s a lot of boiler plate here, but I’ll leave it up to you to make a macro that will deal with all of that for any future imports.

Just remember, when one has to process a large file or needs a special import mechanism, this is often the best way to do it, otherwise a simple  ```Import```  is likely fastest--although there are cases where this does not hold, and if a file takes particularly long to load, using a  ```ReadList```  can be faster.
