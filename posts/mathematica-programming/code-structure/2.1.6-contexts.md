## Contexts

Contexts are a relatively simple concept but have major effects. Their basic use is to tag symbols with extra information. Usually we are in the global context:

	$Context

	(*Out:*)
	
	"Global`"

Although many of the functions we use are not:

	Context@Plot

	(*Out:*)
	
	"System`"

A context is a series of symbol names followed by  ```"`"```

Contexts we can use without fully qualifying the name are those on  ```$ContextPath```

	$ContextPath

	(*Out:*)
	
	{"CloudObjectLoader`","StreamingLoader`","SymbolicMachineLearningLoader`","IconizeLoader`","HTTPHandlingLoader`","PacletManager`","System`","Global`"}

We can define our own contexts via  ```Begin```  and  ```BeginPackage```  and the context is exited via  ```End```  and  ```EndPackage```  respectively. The only difference between these is that  ```BeginPackage```  restricts the value of  ```$ContextPath```  while  ```Begin```  does not:

	BeginPackage["NameTools`"];

	thisIsTheLocalContextPath=$ContextPath;

	EndPackage[]

	thisIsTheLocalContextPath//Context

	(*Out:*)
	
	"NameTools`"

	thisIsTheLocalContextPath

	(*Out:*)
	
	{"NameTools`","System`"}

This protects symbols from being affected by things in the  ```Global` ```  context or any other context.  ```Begin```  does not do this:

	Begin["NameTools`"];

	thisIsTheLocalContextPath=$ContextPath;

	End[];

	thisIsTheLocalContextPath

	(*Out:*)
	
	{"NameTools`","CloudObjectLoader`","StreamingLoader`","SymbolicMachineLearningLoader`","IconizeLoader`","HTTPHandlingLoader`","PacletManager`","System`","Global`"}

Note that  ```BeginPackage```  also prepended the context defined to the  ```$ContextPath``` .

Anything not in  ```NameTools` ```  exactly won’t be found, however:

	NameTools`hidden`a=100

	(*Out:*)
	
	100

	a

	(*Out:*)
	
	a

	a//Context

	(*Out:*)
	
	"Global`"

This is how Mathematica defines so many functions without us having to worry about using the wrong symbols. Just consider all of the symbols we can find in  ```System`Private` ``` :

	Pane[Column@Names@"System`Private`*",{Automatic,100},Scrollbars{False,True},AppearanceElementsNone]

	(*Out:*)
	
![21-7468015508976701203]({filename}/img/21-7468015508976701203.png)

One final useful thing to know is that the current context can be implied when defining a symbol, such as done in the following example:

	`Private`b=100

	(*Out:*)
	
	100

This just had the current context put in front of the first `

	Global`Private`b

	(*Out:*)
	
	100
